        <p>
          Iâ€™m Mahdia Khamoosh, a passionate Front-End Web Developer based in
          Afghanistan. With a background in journalism and technology, I bring
          strong communication skills together with my technical expertise to
          create modern, user-friendly, and responsive web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
          Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS, along with tools like Git, GitHub, and
          Netlify. I enjoy transforming ideas into clean and functional
          interfaces that provide seamless user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into web development started with a deep curiosity about
          technology and the freedom it provides to build and innovate. Since
          then, Iâ€™ve completed several coding workshops, gained certificates,
          and worked on personal projects that reflect my dedication to growth
          and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I value teamwork, problem-solving, and continuous
          learning. My goal is to become a skilled developer who contributes to
          impactful projects, explores advanced technologies, and eventually
          supports other women in tech who face barriers to education and
          opportunities.

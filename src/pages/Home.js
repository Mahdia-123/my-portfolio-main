              I built a Vanilla JavaScript weather app in SheCodes Plus, an
              advanced 8-week JavaScript coding workshop. Building upon my
              previously-gained knowledge, I also became skilled in Bootstrap,
              APIâ€™s, real-life development workflow, hosting, and advanced
              JavaScript. I combined all of these skills to create a
              fully-functioning weather app.

              This Clock Application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
              styled with Bootstrap. It displays the current time dynamically
              and updates every second in real-time. The interface is responsive
              and clean, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile
              devices. It was a fun way to practice DOM manipulation, time
              functions, and Bootstrap layout utilities.

              The AI Poem Generator is a creative web application that uses
              artificial intelligence to craft unique poems on demand. Built
              with HTML and CSS for a clean and responsive design, it leverages
              Bootstrap to ensure a sleek, mobile-friendly interface. JavaScript
              powers the interactive features, communicating with an AI model to
              generate poetic verses based on user input or random prompts.

            <h2>React Weather App</h2>
            <p class="mt-3 mb-5">
              I created a responsive Weather App using React and React-Bootstrap
              to deliver real-time weather updates in a clean, user-friendly
              interface. The app fetches weather data from an external API and
              displays it with intuitive components such as cards, buttons, and
              grids styled using React-Bootstrap. It features search
              functionality for any city, dynamic weather icons, and temperature
              details, all wrapped in a modern, mobile-responsive layout. This
              project helped me strengthen my skills in React, API integration,
              and component-based UI design.
